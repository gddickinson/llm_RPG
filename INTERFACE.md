## Module Index

### engine/battle/ — Phase 17 tactical layer

- **`battle_data.py`** — loaders over `data/battles/*.json`: unit archetypes, formations, matchup RPS + terrain, fortifications, P17.6a grid-terrain cover (`terrain_cover`); all content, no hardcoded stats.
- **`battle_unit.py`** — P17.2 grid pieces: `Soldier` (light token, +P17.4c `move_accum` speed budget) + `Squad` (owns soldiers, ONE morale bar, order/formation/commander, `speed`; rout on morale threshold); round-trips to dict.
- **`battle_field.py`** — P17.2 battle grid: own terrain (P17.6a passable COVER terrains + `cover_at`), WALL/GATE as HP structures breaching to rubble lanes, soldier occupancy, squad/team registry; round-trips to dict for mid-battle saves; P17.6c capture-point objectives (`add_objective`/`team_counts_near`/`captured_team`).
- **`battle_flow.py`** — P17.3 flow fields: multi-source BFS distance field per team (O(map)); soldiers step the gradient toward the enemy and through breaches.
- **`battle_ai.py`** — P17.3 group AI (ported colosseum brain): focus-fire target select, self-contained d20 strike, role movement (archers kite), squad morale/rout; P17.4c `step_toward` greedy push-into-contact when the centroid flow is blocked; P17.6b `nearest_struct` for siege engines homing on walls; P17.13 `charge_attack`/`_shove` (charging cavalry & beasts trample loose foot, shatter on braced spears); P17.11 `_position_mods` (flank/rear/gang-up/surround bonuses via `battle_facing`).
- **`battle_orders.py`** — P17.5 the commander's verbs as behaviour: `advance_intent` maps an order (charge/hold/fall_back/move/focus_fire) to a soldier's out-of-reach intent; `is_focus` concentrates fire; objective-type scaffold. The session + `pick_target` read it.
- **`battle_session.py`** — P17.3 deterministic tick loop; `run_headless(max_ticks)` runs squads to a result (same shape as the resolver); P17.4c multi-step movement by unit `speed` (`MAX_STEPS` cap); P17.5 order-driven movement (`_order_move`: hold/retreat/goto/advance); P17.6b siege battering (rams hammer an adjacent wall to a breach before shooting) + P17.6d ranged bombardment (artillery lobs at a wall from `SIEGE_RANGE`); P17.6c capture-point victory (`_update_objectives`; `over`/`result` end on a seizure); P17.13 `_charge_melee` (charge/overrun momentum in melee).
- **`battle_facing.py`** — P17.11 pure facing/arc geometry: 8-dir `DIRS`, `face_toward`, `arc` → front/flank/rear; feeds the flank/rear to-hit & damage bonuses in `battle_ai`.
- **`battle_scenario.py`** — P17.4 staged set-pieces from `data/battles/scenarios.json`; `build_field(id)` expands one into a tickable `BattleField` (shared by the screen and the tests).
- **`battle_resolve.py`** — P17.1 headless Lanchester auto-resolver: `Army`/`Unit`/`Fort` + seeded `resolve(attacker, defender, terrain, is_siege, seed)`; defence-reduced melee, RPS+speed-softened ranged, cavalry charge, anti-cavalry spears, wall-gated siege with breaches. Deterministic; doubles as the off-screen faction-battle resolver.

### engine/ — Core game logic

- **`game_engine.py`** — `GameEngine`; the thin orchestrator: state, start/end, delegates (438 lines).
- **`netplay.py`** — M.4a networked-play keystone: the transport-free client<->world contract. `Intent` (whitelisted move/attack/say/wait verb naming the acting hero; JSON round-trip) + `GameServer` owning the engine — `join`/`leave` seat heroes in the roster+world, `submit` applies one intent through the real player-action route acting-as that hero WITHOUT ticking the world, `tick` is the server's own world clock, `snapshot` is a JSON view (heroes + nearby NPC bodies). The socket transport (M.4b) is a thin layer over this.
- **`net_server.py`** — M.4b message layer & dispatch (transport-free): newline-JSON framing (`encode`/`FrameDecoder`), the JOIN/INTENT/LEAVE/POLL → WELCOME/RESULT/SNAPSHOT/ERROR protocol, and `NetServer` owning one `GameServer` — connection registry, `on_message` dispatch that binds each client's intents to the hero it JOINED as (anti-spoof), `tick_and_broadcast` for the shared clock. The wire pumps this.
- **`net_socket.py`** — M.4b the real TCP wire over `net_server`: `NetHost` (threaded `ThreadingTCPServer` + optional background ticker that advances + broadcasts snapshots) and `NetClient` (connect/join/intent/poll/leave, caches latest snapshot). Stdlib sockets only; opt-in — the single-process game never imports it.
- **`agent_controller.py`** — M.2 `AgentController` playing a hero through the real player-action API via `acting_as`; `drive_agents(engine)` runs agent roster heroes each turn (advance_turn re-entrancy-guarded). M.2b priority policy: survive (heal-potion/Heal-spell/flee under HP), don't fight swarmed, focus-fire + ranged, grab loot, else wander — LLM-free.
- **`away_mode.py`** — M.3 absent-player heartbeat: ticks the world on a slow cadence while the active hero's human is away (so the driving agent keeps it alive); any keypress hands back.
- **`player_roster.py`** — M.1 `PlayerRoster` (`engine.roster`) + `PlayerController` (human/agent): the roster of controllable characters over `engine.player`; add/`set_active`/`controller_for`, survives save/load via `metadata['controller']`. M.1b: non-active heroes live in the world (placed in `npc_manager` + on the map, flagged `player_char`, rendered as heroes, skipped by NPC AI); `rehydrate` rebuilds the roster after a load. M.3: `set_away`/`is_away`/`away_characters` — an away human's hero is driven by the agent (`drive_agents` includes away humans) until they return. The multiplayer/agent keystone.
- **`engine_setup.py`** — `build_subsystems(engine)`: every gameplay system constructed in dependency order (P14.1 split from __init__).
- **`turn_pipeline.py`** — `run_turn(engine)`: the per-minute pipeline — needs, encounters, companions, conflicts, surfaces, floods, hazards, dying, law, pets — plus the nightly stack; block order is load-bearing (P14.1 split from advance_turn).
- **`demo_setup.py`** — `initialize_demo_world()`, `create_default_player(spec)`.
- **`action_router.py`** — Routes NPC actions to specialized handlers.
- **`combat_system.py`** — Player vs NPC vs NPC combat, damage, defeat, loot, faction rep on kill.
- **`economy_system.py`** — Buy/sell/trade/give between characters.
- **`dialog_system.py`** — Player↔NPC dialog flow (routes through dialog_protocol for LLM providers).
- **`conversation.py`** — PUX.6 the conversation quick-pick menu: `menu(engine, npc)` lists an NPC's quests (accept/turn-in), Trade (`is_merchant`), askable topics, and unlockable secrets as numbered options the dialog screen dispatches.
- **`dialog_protocol.py`** — Structured JSON dialog contract: whitelisted actions, engine-validated execution.
- **`npc_memory.py`** — Per-NPC memory: recency×importance×relevance retrieval, verbatim dialog log, nightly reflection → opinions.
- **`secrets.py`** — Gated NPC secrets from `data/secrets.json`; locked secrets never reach the prompt (injection-proof).
- **`persuasion.py`** — `/persuade` `/intimidate` `/deceive` social checks; LLM or dice adjudication, day-long lockouts, haggle tokens.
- **`heart_events.py`** — Affinity-threshold scenes from `data/heart_events.json`; authored outlines, LLM-rendered prose, perks.
- **`topics.py`** — `TopicJournal`; keywords heard anywhere become askable topics (Y-key journal), per-NPC authored answers.
- **`director.py`** — `WorldDirector`; one nightly call emits structured events (rumor/shortage/caravan/sighting/feud) the systems act out.
- **`player_deeds.py`** — Rolling deeds ledger + presence digest; NPCs react to kills, quests, gear, level.
- **`llm_budget.py`** — Cost discipline: NPC action cooldowns, monster exclusion, greeting cache.
- **`guild.py`** — `GuildSystem`; quest points → ranks (Member/Veteran/Champion) with radiant/teleport/party perks.
- **`tutorial.py`** — `TutorialManager`; teach-by-doing steps, hint-bar lessons, one-way boat departure.
- **`legends.py`** — Relic pickups reveal authored legends; Legends section of the Y journal; gossip citations.
- **`defeat.py`** — Failure-as-story defeat outcomes: robbed / left for dead / slain.
- **`dying.py`** — P12.4 Dying & Wounded: 0 HP → Dying 1–4 with per-turn flat recovery checks; stabilize = +1 Wounded + gentle story beat, Dying 4 = the full defeat table; people (not monsters) are KO'd into robbable bodies that wake overnight with grudges.
- **`item_use.py`** — `use_item(engine, name)`: every on-use payload (scrolls, tomes, manuals, potions, remedies, P12.3 drinks, food); `transmute_item` (P13.1: any carried item → 40% value in gold, mana-gated, [T] in the I-panel); identity-first `_remove_one`.
- **`food.py`** — P12.5 food economy: 2-turn chew delay gates attacks after eating, combo food bypasses it, the Hearty Brew overheals + curses; freshness decays nightly (stale = half heal + poison risk), hearths re-bake carried rations.
- **`combat_depth.py`** — P12.7: concentration (one sustained spell; damage forces d20+CON vs max(10,dmg)), soft cover on the shot line (-10%/-25% hit, carried on projectiles), BG3 weapon actions as weapon data (Cleave/Topple/Pommel Strike/Lacerate, SHIFT+V, once per rest).
- **`ranged.py`** — `shoot_ranged(engine, ...)`: bow/crossbow/thrown fire with ammo, aim, chew gate, true LOS (split from game_api_mixin).
- **`skill_actions.py`** — P12.8 combat verbs on the graded core: Trip (SHIFT+T), Demoralize (SHIFT+I, 10-min per-target immunity), Feint (SHIFT+B), Battle Medicine (SHIFT+H, burns a bandage, once/day/patient); degree-sensitive outcomes both ways.
- **`bones.py`** — P12.13 NetHack bones: true deaths snapshot site/gear/slayer to the Legendarium root; new campaigns roll 1/3 to raise a flying ghost of the fallen guarding their (70% haunted, curse-on-equip) gear.
- **`wounds.py`** — P15.9 body-part health: 5 parts, severity 0–3; serious hits break a bone (head→checks, arms→attack, legs→step time, torso→HP ceiling); crippled limbs fester (P12.12); knit by sleep/camp/Battle Medicine; state on player.metadata.
- **`infection.py`** — P12.12 the infection race: dirty wounds (stabilize/ashore/crit-bleed) start it; nightly infection +28 vs immunity +21×rest-quality; Battle Medicine subtracts by degree (+cleric assist); infection 100 = fever crisis into the dying state, immunity 100 = clean.
- **`bonds.py`** — P12.11 the bond ceremony: /bond shares a drink (once per NPC) minting spendable trust; /spend secret (past gates) · skill (+150 XP lesson) · join (recruit at 20 + 12×level-gap); faction behavior thresholds gate trade/recruitment/petty-bounty forgiveness.
- **`ransom.py`** — P13.2 ransom & rescue: SHIFT+G hoists a KO'd body (6 pack slots, slow steps); set down beside a cleric = rescue (gold, +rep, warm memory) or the fence = ransom (level-priced gold, −rep, witnessed bounty, grudge); mid-carry wakes give the benefit of the doubt.
- **`law.py`** — `LawSystem` (P12.9): per-settlement bounty ledger fed by break-ins/assault/robbery; adjacent guard + local bounty opens the 1-5 confrontation menu (pay / jail with skill-XP cost / bribe / one graded talk / resist); walking away shelves, never clears. Part 2: stolen flags (`mark_stolen`/`is_stolen`/`fence_sale` — honest merchants refuse, the fence pays 60% after 3 unseen break-ins), hearth laundering, witness outfit memory (guards only confront a matching outfit — armor changes are disguises).
- **`tactics.py`** — Opportunity attacks, SHIFT+move disengage, SHIFT+F shove.
- **`faction_ticker.py`** — Daily dice-resolved faction events; strength/stores drive encounters, shortages, rumors; repelled raids spawn a visible straggler.
- **`npc_conflict.py`** — `NPCConflictSystem` (P7.1): guards fight hostiles they can see, hostiles raid civilians; `[Clash]` events near the player; the player's duel is never stolen; overworld-grid NPCs only.
- **`retaliation.py`** — `RetaliationSystem` (P7.2): deep hostile faction rep → warning rumor, then level-scaled bounty hunters converge on the player; nightly check, persisted, escalation ladder per faction.
- **`squad_tactics.py`** — P7.3 positional helpers shared by companions/guards/packs: `surround_step` (fan out around targets), `flank_tile` (+2 flanking spot), `player_focus_target` (focus fire), `path_step` (BFS with greedy fallback), `greedy_step`.
- **`disease.py`** — `DiseaseSystem` (P8.2): outbreaks/contagion/immunity from `data/diseases.json`; state in character metadata; player symptom drain (never kills); the right remedy cures via item use; nightly tick.
- **`pantheon.py`** — `PantheonSystem` (P8.4): five gods from `data/pantheon.json`; deeds build favor (player_deeds hook), SHIFT+P prayer at shrines/temples, favor-funded miracles (heal/bless/fortune/cure/insight), nightly omens at deep favor.
- **`market.py`** — `MarketSystem` (P8.5): tâtonnement price indices per category (arms/provisions/goods/arcana); purchases/sales move prices, nights drift them home; multiplies buy AND sell in shop pricing; persisted.
- **`doors.py`** — `DoorManager` (P9A.1): door policies from `data/doors.json` (homes locked, shops night-locked, taverns open); key/lockpick/SHIFT+TAB-force paths; forcing is noisy and remembered; dawn resets; persisted.
- **`homestead.py`** — P15.7 claim a home: buy an unowned derelict (`claim`, size-scaled, ownership on `location.properties`), a staged repair ConstructionProject (`repair`/`home_action`, spends timber+stone+coin+time, furnishes bed/hearth/chest on completion), free Well-Rested sleep at your finished home (`can_rest_home`, wired into `rest.py`), and a persistent storage chest (`deposit`/`withdraw`/`chest_interact`, item dicts on `player.metadata`). One home at a time; E-key + I-panel `H` + hint-bar wired.
- **`furniture.py`** — P9A.2: E beside interior furniture — beds rest (+30% HP/day), hearths cook, altars pray, shelves surface rumors, chests/barrels rummage; flavor for the rest; cooldowns in player.metadata.
- **`trespass.py`** — `TrespassSystem` (P9A.4): private homes + after-hours shops; witnessed trespass costs rep/relationship/memory; forced entry is a crime — guards converge on the alert, repeat offenses reach the P7.2 bounty ladder.
- **`presence.py`** — P9A.7: NPCs within an enterable footprint are INDOORS — hidden from the street, shown inside as the same entities at zone-local spots; `npc_adjacent_to_player` is THE adjacency check (talk/hints/melee/barter).
- **`carry.py`** — carry capacity (George): slot-based pack, 18 + 2 per STR modifier; `can_carry`/`full_message` enforced at pickup/forage/gather/harvest/shop/rummage/chests.
- **`targeting.py`** — `TargetingSystem` (P8.7): [ ] cycle / click-to-target locks with range + true LOS; auto-refresh each turn; reticle + hint bar; bow and attack spells fire at the lock.
- **`tile_damage.py`** — `TileDamage` (P10.2): sparse tile HP + materials (stone resists fire, wood burns); walls crack → RUBBLE (a breach is a second door); fire scorches; persisted.
- **`surfaces.py`** — `SurfaceLayer` (P10.3): sparse fire/oil/water per-tile surfaces; fire burns occupants + tiles and spreads; oil pools chain-ignite; water douses; per-turn tick; persisted; DM-paintable. P14.2a: blood pools from serious wounds (conduct, never burn) + `electrify` — lightning races through connected water/blood (shock spell triggers it), zapping occupants, fading back to water.
- **`bosses.py`** — P15.6 boss set-pieces: data `boss` block gives telegraphed AoE (mark a tile, blast it next turn) via `boss_tick`, and once-only HP-threshold phases via `boss_on_damaged` (enrage/flood/electrify/summon); Giant Warlord, Tyrant of the Depths, Wisp Queen.
- **`giants.py`** — Giants + labor (P10.5): `is_giant`/`giant_tick` (smash walls to deep rubble, hurl boulders — maims the player, real splash deaths) on the conflict scan; nightly `run_night_labor` (crews clear rubble by buildings, masons rebuild breached walls, scorched ground regrows).
- **`flood.py`** — `FloodSystem` (P10.6): cellular flood frontier over low ground, dammed by rubble/buildings/mountains; recedes restoring original terrain; occupied tiles never flooded; storm-burst chance; persisted.
- **`earthworks.py`** — P10.6: the E-key ground fallback (clear rubble, then pickaxe-dig adjacent mountains — 4 swings tunnel to grass, trains Mining); `footprint_to_perimeter`/`sync_breaches`/`close_breach` breach mapping shared by entry-sync and the night masons.
- **`rest.py`** — Enter-to-sleep at inns; dawn wake, restoration, day-summary overlay; P12.6 tiers: 15g private room grants well_rested (+10% XP), 5g bunk; routes outdoor Enter to camping.
- **`camping.py`** — P12.6: camp anywhere outdoors — burns provisions (supplied = real night, unsupplied = doze), 25% wilderness ambush at dawn; `night_beat` = the DM's guaranteed `[DM]` dream after every sleep (dm_autonomous.night_scene overrides).

- **`module_packs.py`** — Module packs (P1.4 + P14.2b): authored campaign packs install at new-game start; packs ship monsters/items/spawns/quests/beats AND structures (charter-checked, budget-free, Legendarium-inherited); structures-only packs valid.
- **`memory_manager.py`** — Event history + `on_event` observer hook (feeds the topic journal).
- **`save_load.py`** — JSON full-state save/load.
- **`skills.py`** — D&D-style skill checks; P12.1 degrees of success: `check()` → `CheckResult` with `Degree` (crit ±10 margins, nat 20/1 shift one degree) — lockpicking, forcing, persuasion, shove, and forage all route through it.

## Engine subsystems wired to the game loop

Each turn (after a player move / dialog / action):
1. `world.advance_time(1)` — calendar minute passes
2. `quest_manager.on_turn_advanced()` — SURVIVE objectives tick
3. NPC needs tick — hunger / fatigue grow
4. `encounter_manager.maybe_spawn()` — chance of wilderness monster
5. `companion_manager.update()` — party members follow / fight
6. Every N turns: NPC actions (LLM or heuristic-based, including schedules)

## Adding new content — quick recipes

- **New item**: add an entry to the matching `data/items/*.json` file (only non-default fields needed).
- **New campaign pack**: drop a module JSON (monsters/items/spawns/quests/beats, see `engine/dm_modules.py` docstring) into `data/module_packs/`; use `"anchor": "wilderness"` instead of positions; run the validator.
- **New recipe**: add an entry to `data/recipes.json`.
- **New quest**: add an entry to `data/quests.json`; post to a board via `default_boards()` if appropriate.
- **New named NPC**: add an entry to the matching `data/npcs/*.json` file.
- **New NPC class**: extend `CharacterClass` in `characters/character_types.py`; add schedule in `characters/schedules.py`; add to `CLASS_TO_FACTION` in `characters/factions.py`.
- **New action**: add handler in `engine/action_router.py`.
- **New terrain**: extend `TerrainType` + add sprite in `ui/sprite_loader.py`.
- **New monster**: add an entry to `data/monsters.json` (`encounter_weight` for wilderness, `"dungeon": true` for dungeons).
- **New LLM provider**: subclass `LLMProvider` in `llm/providers/`, register in `llm/providers/__init__.py`.

## File size policy

All source files stay **under 500 lines** (per global coding preferences). Split modules before exceeding.
